Mainly I learnt to center a .div at the middle of the screen and also to add the website icon.

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
body{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
.d-flex{
    height: 100vh;
}
```
